## üëã Greetings! My name is Adrian Bautista!

I am 21 years old, currently studying Computer Science at UIC, and Game Development on my own. 

Since my junior year of high school, I've been passionate about video games, particularly story-driven ones. What draws me to games isn't just the excitement, but the valuable life lessons they offer. They've also helped me manage stress, provided an escape from reality, and honed my problem-solving and creative thinking skills. Some characters have even influenced my personality and motivated me to persist in life, even when I'm at my lowest. This deep connection to gaming sparked my interest in computer science, with the ultimate goal of becoming a game developer.

I've been fascinated by the endless possibilities in computer science, such as building websites, AI, and (of course) video games. Currently, I'm studying computer science at university, where I focus on programming techniques to run smooth programs. In my free time, I will sometimes watch game development videos, exploring what makes games engaging and memorable. Every game I play, every game development video I watch, and every lesson I learn from my classes motivates me to take action and create games I dream of.

My ultimate goal is to become a game developer and bring joy, excitement, and life lessons to others through the games I create.
