## 👋 Greetings! Welcome to My Profile!
I am 22 years old and currently studying Computer Science at UIC and Game Development independently. 

**Biography:**

Since my junior year of high school, I've been passionate about video games, particularly those with story-driven narratives—not just for fun, but for the life lessons they teach. Gaming has helped me manage stress, sharpen my problem-solving skills, and inspired me during tough times. Thus, this passion led me to study computer science and to become a game/indie developer.

I'm fascinated by the possibilities in computer science, from building websites to creating games. I am currently learning programming at university and enjoy watching game development videos to understand what makes games engaging. Every game I play and lesson I learn drives me to create games that bring joy and meaningful experiences to others.
