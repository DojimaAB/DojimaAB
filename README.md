## üëã Greetings! Welcome to my profile!

I am 21 years old and currently studying Computer Science at UIC and Game Development on my own. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since my junior year of high school, I have been passionate about video games, particularly story-driven ones. What draws me to games is not just the excitement, but the valuable life lessons they offer. They have also helped me manage stress, provided an escape from reality, and honed my problem-solving and creative thinking skills. Some characters have influenced my personality and motivated me to persist in life, even at my lowest. This deep connection to gaming sparked my interest in computer science, with the ultimate goal of becoming a game developer.

I have been fascinated by the endless possibilities in computer science, such as building websites, AI, and (of course) video games. I am studying computer science at university, where I focus on programming techniques to run smooth programs. I sometimes watch game development videos in my free time, exploring what makes games engaging and memorable. Every game I play, every game development video I watch, and every lesson I learn from my classes motivates me to take action and create games I dream of.

My ultimate goal is to become a game developer and use the games I create to bring others joy, excitement, and life lessons.
