## Greetings! 👋

I am 21 years old, currently studying Computer Science at UIC and Game Development on my own time. 

- I love playing video games (especially story-based games) because they are thrilling and provide valuable lessons in life via storytelling
- Video games inspired me to study Computer Science to learn how to make games via programming
- I also learn about Game Design on my own time to learn what makes good games "good"
- My main goal is to because a game developer to share joy and valuable lessons in life to everyone
